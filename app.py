    The {APP_TITLE} is an AI-powered tool designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes

    Our tool uses advanced AI to analyze how well your resume (as an image of its first page) 
    matches specific job descriptions, identifying strengths and areas for improvement.
    
    ### Key Features:
    - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Get detailed feedback on resume alignment.
    - **Keyword Matching**: Identify missing keywords to improve ATS score.
    - **Match Percentage**: See a quantitative assessment of compatibility.
    - **Improvement Suggestions**: Receive actionable advice to enhance your resume.
    
    ### How ATS Systems Work (Generally):
    Applicant Tracking Systems often parse text from resumes to scan for relevant keywords, 
    experience, and qualifications. Our tool simulates a part of this by visually analyzing 
    the resume's first page against the job description.
    Up to 75% of resumes can be rejected by ATS before reaching human reviewers.
